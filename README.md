# RShiny_dashboard
Creating a dashboard on R Shiny that will allow us to visualize datasets.

This project consists of a simple shiny dashboard created for the purpose of practice. The dashboard shows some interactive graphs and trends of COVID-19 cases across the globe over a date range. 

The dataset used for this project is the "WHO-COVID 19 global-data.csv" and is taken from the following link: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/coronavirus-covid-19-cases-and-deaths. 

The following are snapshots of the shiny dashboard created.

The below image shows the first item of the dashboard body. The 'Data' menu item in the sidebar opens up a box in the dashboard body which displays information about the dataset.

The second menu item in the sidebar is created to show different graphs related to the data. Two tab panels are created for two different graphs.
